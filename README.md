In this project, I focus on detecting online
payment fraud using machine learning
techniques. With the rise of digital
transactions, it has become increasingly
important for financial institutions to
accurately identify fraudulent activities. To
address this challenge, I utilized a dataset
sourced from Kaggle, which contains historical
information about online transactions,
including key features such as transaction
type, amount, originating and destination
account balances, and a binary indicator of
whether each transaction was fraudulent.
The project began with data preparation,
where I explored the dataset and addressed
any missing values. I applied encoding
techniques to convert categorical variables
into numerical formats suitable for machine
learning algorithms. After preprocessing the
data, I split the dataset into training and
testing subsets.
I implemented various classification models,
including Logistic Regression and Random
Forest, to categorize transactions as
fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Each model was
trained on the training dataset and evaluated
on the test set using performance metrics
such as accuracy, precision, and recall, with a
particular emphasis on minimizing false
negatives.
Through this analysis, I aimed to improve the
accuracy of fraud detection systems,
contributing to a more secure online payment
environment. The findings highlight the
effectiveness of machine learning in
combating financial fraud and provide a solid
foundation for future research in this vital area.
